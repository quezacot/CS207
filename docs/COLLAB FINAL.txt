As previously mentioned, we used four groups・ code for our final project. For all of the code, we had to make some minor adjustments to fit the code with our tetrahedral mesh. Most of the groups wrote their code with a triangle mesh in mind. Therefore, sometimes we had to go to the hpp files to modify the function calls.
1.	We implemented Tian Lan・s and Xide Xia・s wind force so that we can utilize the wind force to blow the ball around in the box. In addition, we also utilized their collision force calculation to calculate the node・s position and velocity after the node collides with another mesh. They were really a great resource for us and were helpful in answering questions about their code.
2.	We merged Ruitao Du・s and Yingzhuo Zhang・s listener with Aaron・s and Fil・s listener. Ruitao and Yingzhuo were helpful in answering questions about the functionalities of their code and we were successful in using their wind force listener. Aaron・s and Fil・s listener was well designed and had flexible structure. Their documentation also clearly illustrated how to customize listeners based on their code. We were able to adopt their listener to implement our own ones successfully.
3.	Lastly, we used Erik・s and Lukas・ collision detection. We had to go into the hpp files to make changes since their collision detector is triangle mesh based. Overall, it was a great module and worked really well. We were very impressed by their modules・ functionalities and it was very easy to implement in our code.
